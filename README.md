Phase 3 :
      Linked list and Likned list manuplation and
      types of Linkelist:
          ->Singly linked list
          ->Doubly linked list 
          ->circular liked list all type implemented.
      Stack using STL and implementaton and oprations,
      ->Stack ,
      ->TwoStack
      Queue opration using STL and Queue implmentation and its opreation,
      ->Circular Queue,
      ->Double Ended Queue
